# React Email Marketing Software for Email extraction ( With a live demo ) !

This is an email marketing software extract all emails from any text placed in the input box and it calculates the number of emails found instantly. This is a standard email marketing tool for email marketers and also a great way for a javascript programmer to learn new ways to use regular expressions. 

# Programming concepts used

For state management I made used of a single useReducer hook, in combination with react's context api. 

For the extraction of emails, I made use of regular expressions in combination with javascript string methods: split and match .

Yes those are the major tools I used for this software. And yes it is easy to extend. One major thing you can do to extend this code is to extract all the top level domains in these emails and displaying them in another text box. Just have fun!
